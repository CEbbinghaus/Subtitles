22. July 2004
<i>Find me somebody</i>

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:20,100
<i>to hug and kiss me soon.</i>

16
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,970
- Was the White House informed?
- No. Too Risky. 
The President Is amidst an election campaign.

17
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,959
Don't let it slip! It would
provoke a global mass hysteria.

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,360
- We imposed a gag order.
- Does the Pentagon think it's dangerous?

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,440
General, I commend Defcon 2.

20
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,843
Be careful, Sir.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,671
Oh my God!

22
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:06,239
Watcha lookin' at?

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,000
(300 years later)

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,167
<i>(Regulator)</i> Once upon a time our
ancestors came from Earth to colonize Mars.

25
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,100
Today we return to Earth...

26
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:08,280
to once and for all
annilihate its pathetic inhabitants!

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Jens, my trusty disciple,
our vision has come true.

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,360
Earth belongs us now!

29
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
Queen Metapha, we are defenseless.

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,120
The attack met us unprepared.
Our fleet has been destroyed.

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
- How can that be?
- They deciphered our shield access codes!

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,257
They can even
bug our local calls.

33
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:00,957
Mars makes you mobile

34
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:05,529
- Majesty, we must surrender!
- Oh no, you cannot do that!

35
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,486
forgive me.

36
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:11,100
Those Martians came
down upon us like grasshoppers.

37
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,559
Their troops are stationed
all around the globe

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,199
But we can't just stick
our sand in the head

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,359
in two hours at the latest the Mars Regulator
will be sitting on your throne!
we have already lost 

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,960
- There could be one last chance.
- What do you mean?

41
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:28,071
Time travel.

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
(whispers) The sideffects are unjustifiable.
- But time travel is prohibited!

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
I think we can bend the rules a little.
Please go on.

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,233
We must travel back in time
and prevent the colonization of Mars.

45
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:46,750
- Only so can we prevent this war.
- Absurd! We don't even know

46
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:51,600
whether time travel is safe for humans.
We've never tested it.

47
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
- And who would be able to do this?
- I was thinking of...

48
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,783
- the Surprise crew!
- Oh Goodness! Why those of all people!

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,760
<i>'Cause we're so pretty and so smart</i>
<i>and so slim and so slender</i>

50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,120
<i>We'll be Miss Waikiki!</i>

51
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
<i>And shower to the left!</i>
<i>And shower to the right!</i>

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,117
<i>And don't forget the soap!</i>

53
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>One more time!</i>
<i>And five, six, seven, eight</i>

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,360
<i>Five, six, seven, eight</i>
<i>And touch and push!</i>

55
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,320
<i>And touch and push!</i>
<i>And towel to the left!</i>

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,480
<i>And towel to the right!</i>
<i>And don't forget the willy!</i>

57
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>Dry the willy to the beat!</i>

58
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,956
- You cannot be serious!
- We have no other choice

59
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:43,917
They are mankind's last hope.
Or are there any volunteers?

60
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,371
So basically you are saying
that the salvation of Earth

61
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:51,114
Depends on this crew of all things

62
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,886
If you put it that way, senator Eric...

63
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,486
Yes!

64
00:05:56,186 --> 00:06:01,000
We have no idea where they are.
No word from them in years!

65
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,014
We will just have to find them then

66
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,492
there they are!

67
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,328
I can't believe it
How could they veer off course this far?

68
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:49,756
Contact them immediately!

69
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:52,571
- There are in the middle of nowhere!
- Are you really surprised?.

70
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
Captain's log no. 1 of our
Traumschiff Surprise, Captain Kork.

71
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
It's way too chilly for this stardate.

72
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
All 40 men of my crew are in good health.

73
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,440
Only two have a slight cold.
Gunther has blackboard duty for this week.

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,814
I am worried that in five months from now
we'll run out of stamps.

75
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,757
We have got to do something about that.
But not right now.

76
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:24,270
Today we have our yearly health check
before the summer holidays start.

77
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,567
Looking forward to having
my temperature taken.

78
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,100
if all is fine, I'll have a nice Schnitzel
with french fries and ketchup,

79
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:33,608
a small mixed salad and 
to drink a large spezi.

80
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,213
- The same fagging every year!
- The Honolulu bathing season starts in two weeks!

81
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,440
You'll need a flawless waistline
if you want to be Miss Waikiki!

82
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,825
Constantly does my back in though.

83
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:52,717
Since when do vulcanettes
even have a spine?

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
- None of yours, you dumb cow!
- He's not even a purebred Vulcanette.

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,757
- Oh, I am!
- No, you're a mutt!

86
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,957
<i>Gasp</i>

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,833
I am a Vulcanette Vulgaris.
We can be up to 400 years old because we are

88
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,160
a type of Galapagos turtle!

89
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,042
- And what are you?
- I'm the captain.

90
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:11,025
- You just screwed your way up!
- So what's so bad about that?

91
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,479
Galapagos turtle!
That's why you're so slow!

92
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,558
and you have a baboon's ass!

93
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:16,925
My oh my

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,492
<i>(All)</i> So?
- Your values are disastrous, as always.

95
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,733
whats this now?
This is Bottle. What's up?

96
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,720
Hey captain its someone from Earth.

97
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,707
- I'm not here.
- He isn't here

98
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,983
Tell Mr. Nasi to turn on
the answering machine.

99
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:38,425
Got it? Bottle out.
Let's go! Get ready for the hovering test.

100
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,680
Yes!

101
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:45,142
Your majesty we are having difficulties
contacting the Surprise.

102
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:49,800
- But you have their coordinates!
- Sure, but... we are only reaching
their mailbox

103
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
<i>(All)</i> What? 
- What?

104
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,108
They're available from Monday
through Friday from 4 to 5 pm.

105
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:58,875
This can't be real, Get that crew down here!
There's not much time left!

106
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:02,920
- Aye, Sir!
- Wonder what those guys are doing.

107
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,640
Picking nose and swinging balls!

108
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,513
<i>(Both)</i> "Picking nose and swinging balls!"

109
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:09,750
That stops today.
From now on it's push ups and squats.

110
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,239
He can do that himself

111
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,558
Commencing hovering test.

112
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,400
That can't be! Those
asses won't move a bit.

113
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
<i>Oh my, now what do we have here?</i>

114
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:35,775
<i>I better put this away</i>
<i>before the captain bags it.</i>

115
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,175
- Captain, aren't we supposed to be hovering?
- Doc, why aren't we weightless?

116
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:52,240
Its no wonder!
 Eating Cheesecake and chocolates all the time!
You're too fat to be weightless!

117
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:54,817
Hold on a minute.
I used to be in the hovering club!

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,040
I was the youngest ever
in the hovering marathon!

119
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,975
I made my license in freestyle hovering
when I was 12,

120
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:05,200
and at the age of 14 I won the Little Gold Star
at the national youth hovering contest in Swabia!

121
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,080
I am Hermes, messenger of the Gods! 

122
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,467
Adieu!

123
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:13,333
- Did you know he's got cellulitis?
- Really?
- Yeah

124
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,840
- Where?
- In his room.

125
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Just you wait, I'll get you!

126
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
Yes! I'm hovering!

127
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Mr. Smock, come up here!
It's wonderful up here!

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,092
- I can't! 
- He can't. C'mon, flat out, doc!

129
00:10:37,093 --> 00:10:39,200
- Is that all you got?
- Geez, really

130
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,283
- I can't get that fat Vulcanette up.

131
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
- Hey, what's that?
- This is unacceptable!

132
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,542
- What's going on there?
- Geez, really!

133
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,208
- Hi!
- That's mine.

134
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,533
- Who left his roller skates lying here?
- There!

135
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,442
Miss Bora-Bora! Next time you'll
have a one-week ban on cheesecake!

136
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,524
And out with that chewing gum!
Mr. Nasi, what's the situation?

137
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:16,183
Ha, Captain!

138
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:28,199
(Nasi speaks Cantonese)

139
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,080
Mr Spock Did you understand
what he just said?

140
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,642
- Bora Bora stuck her tongue out at me!
- That's no emergency, Mr. Nasi!

141
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:39,300
Captain, there's something strange
and a little scary going on.

142
00:11:39,336 --> 00:11:43,491
Someone sending an emergency signal.
But its completely unreadable

143
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:46,358
Emergency signal?
Who'd do something like that?

144
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,133
- Captain?
- Careful, don't get too close.

145
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:53,920
The automatic control system
shows a low sliding factor.

146
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,858
They use modulated pulsing vibrations...

147
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,117
to push through to us.

148
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,400
- Yeah, So?
- Shall we let them in?

149
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,825
Never
We can't let it get so far!

150
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,492
Pug speed!

151
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
Pug speed!

152
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,008
Captain, with all due respect,
but pug speed's not possible right now.

153
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,926
- Why not?
- We have rodent damage.

154
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,479
- Well. Let's call it a day.

155
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
- Captain?
- What now?

156
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,071
I don't know what it is, but...

157
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:33,040
it's heading toward us.

158
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh my, madness. What a stress!

159
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,200
Read it!

160
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Red alert.

161
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,000
Set course for Earth
and contact the government immediately.

162
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,675
No way! We're in the middle of
training for the Miss Waikiki contest!

163
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,525
We will have to
prioritize here, right Mr. Spock?

164
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,358
- Ah, Captain?
- What is it?

165
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:04,617
Disobeying orders will get
your holidays cancelled.

166
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,392
Majesty, we recieved a reply
from the Surprise.

167
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,975
Finally. What do they write?

168
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:16,233
"Need something from the servo?"

169
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,482
What do you think
they mean with servo?

170
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:21,992
- Maybe it's a code.
- Ah! When do they get here?

171
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,800
We have less than an hour!

172
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,667
They could do it in 20 minutes
with pug speed sir.

173
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,583
But there's a problem your majesty.

174
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,050
What kind of Problem?

175
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,183
- Rodent damage.

176
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,960
Yes, I know.
I've been in treatment for a while.

177
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,560
I hope they don't try to beam.
It would kill them over that distance.

178
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,120
Get ready to beam! Activate!
Activate!

179
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,200
To be beamed or be beamed not
you need to be on the right spot!

180
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,480
Shoo!

181
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
- Ouch! Spotty, you mad?
- Mutiny!

182
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,400
- You'll have a single room on Honolulu!
 - Geez, really! - Those things happen on Economy.

183
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,920
Economy? You stupid? I'm the captain!
You'll beam me on Business!

184
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,040
- The battery's too weak for Business.
- That beam goat probably...

185
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
- left the lights on again.
- Careful, here he comes.

186
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Aha! Out with that!

187
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
- What is that?
- Friendship rings.

188
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,760
From a befriended DA.
That's all I'll say about that.

189
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,840
And what's in your pants?

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
- None of yours!
- Pants down. Pants down!

191
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
Yehes!

192
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,120
- Radiation protection.
- What for?

193
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,160
- Beaming always gets on my balls.
- Captain, I can't work like that!

194
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Okay! But then you pay the cab!

195
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,880
- What is your report?
- Grab a seat, Regulator!

196
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Madam Metapha got real crazy
boombastic plan! The plan is...

197
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,640
The Plan is... the plan...

198
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay, I forget.
Sorry, Regulator-man, listen!

199
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,440
I write information on paper
and call you back later. Ok?

200
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Walkie talkie, man!

201
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
What was that? Since when
do amateurs work for my empire?

202
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800
My Regulator, that one
was a special offer at Rent-a-Spy.

203
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,440
Along we got this cactus for free.
I can send him back.

204
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,480
- Make it so. But we'll keep the cactus.
- Yes, master.

205
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,560
Jens, my trusty disciple.
I have a mission for you. - What?

206
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,200
Find out what those Earth maggots are
planning, so I can finally crush them.

207
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,240
Crushing! That's good!

208
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,840
For the beautification of our ship!
For the beautification of our ship!

209
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
For the beautification of our ship!

210
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,080
- For the beautification of our ship!
- Well, yeah, okay.

211
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
Give her something!

212
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Thanks!
Save the whales! Find Nemo!

213
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,120
- Got your passport? Closed the window?
- Yes, I even closed the blinds.

214
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I told you not to do that!
Everyone will know we're not at home!

215
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,240
- Arguing again?
- Go away.

216
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,320
- There's something on you head.
- That is my travelling hat.

217
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
- Why do you need a travelling hat?
- I'm paying the cab, so I'll come along.

218
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,743
- And what's that?
- That's Jutta. My reading lamp.

219
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:57,480
- It's saved my life before.
- What kind of junker is that?

220
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,000
- The cheapest again, huh?
- I like it.

221
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,520
- Who of you ordered a cab?
- Me! That was me! That was my idea!

222
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,880
- Who of you guys wants in the back?
- <i>(All)</i> Me! Me! Me!

223
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,080
I want the window seat!

224
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,320
- You cooing?
- What?

225
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,360
- You're cooing over him!
- No, I'm not.

226
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
- Then let him coo a little.
- Shut up and look out the window.

227
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
- So, where to?
- Earth. City of Government.

228
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,240
- Whoops! That'll be expensive.
- Why's that?

229
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,440
Right now, it'd be easier to give
someone plastic surgery during an earthquake

230
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,640
than to arrive there in one piece.
They're firing heavy ordnance down there.

231
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh yes, life vests and parachutes
should be somewhere below that seat.

232
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,200
- Maybe we should get out of here?
- He's just boasting.

233
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
No problem. Just fly.
I am expected by the government.

234
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,520
My name is Captain Kork. Capricorn.
I am Hermes. Messenger of the Gods.

235
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,320
- And what is your name?
- Rock. - Soft or Hard Rock?

236
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
Grab onto something!

237
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,520
<i>(All)</i> Yes!

238
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,440
You can now buy duty free goods.
Anyone care for some music?

239
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,000
<i>(All)</i> Sure!

240
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,440
<i>High, High, High-Ti-Tigh,</i>

241
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>Space-Taxi to the sky.</i>

242
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,600
<i>High, High, High-Ti-Tigh,</i>

243
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,920
<i>Space-Taxi to the sky.</i>

244
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,640
<i>Space-Taxi to the sky.</i>

245
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,800
<i>Come on.</i>

246
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,640
<i>... My little heart... </i>
<i>... so hot... </i>

247
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,680
<i>... spread your legs apart... </i>
<i> Check it out!</i>

248
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
<i>... now let's start the show!</i>
<i>Eenie meenie miny moe!</i>

249
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,360
<i>High, High, High-Ti-Tigh,</i>

250
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,840
<i>Space-Taxi to the sky.</i>

251
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,280
<i>High, High...</i>

252
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,600
What's the commotion?

253
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,960
Okay girls, party's over.

254
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I'll report that one!
Spotty, keep that plate number in mind!

255
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
- Anyone got ink eraser?
- And I went to the washing bay yesterday.

256
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,520
Just stop it!
I'll be getting spots from all this stress!

257
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Blow slowly, girls.
You'll get dizzy.

258
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Okay, now we have a problem.
This is the captain. Don't mind the shaking.

259
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,880
We only lost our shields,
one thruster went down...

260
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,040
- and the plasma tank is leaking.
- I noticed that! The general condition of your...

261
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,960
Sit down, man!

262
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
<i>Take the third exit at the roundabout</i>

263
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,080
<i>You are approaching the exit.</i>
Geez, finally!

264
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,360
<i>Turn right after 500 metres.</i>
Not so good right now.

265
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
You took the wrong turn!

266
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
C'mon, baby, don't let me down!

267
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,840
- Could you turn off the air conditioning?
- Could you shut up for a second?

268
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
<i>When possible please make a U turn</i>
- Good idea!

269
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
<i>Please wait.</i>

270
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Please hold the line.</i>

271
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,880
<i>You are approaching your destination.</i>

272
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,040
Ensalada mista, Baby!

273
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Don't be foolish.
Your city is completely surrounded.

274
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,360
My battlecookie squadron will
be ready to attack in a few minutes.

275
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,600
If you haven't signed the
unconditional surrender by then

276
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,200
I will destroy you.

277
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,360
It is futile. We have to surrender
while we still have a chance.

278
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,400
You are right. We cannot
wait any longer for the crew of the Surprise.

279
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,560
- That must be them.
- Heyho! Is the cheese cake ready?

280
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Inform the queen!

281
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,280
- That was in style back then.
- I can't read that.

282
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
- Rock.
- Rock what?

283
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,960
- Rock Thats-It.
- What?

284
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,640
My ex-wife's name is Thats.
Mine's It. That's it.

285
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,720
Thank you, Mr. Thats-It.
You have been of great help to us.

286
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,840
What? And who'll
pay for the damage?

287
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,840
- A new paint job will do, I think.
- Yes! Pink Camouflage!

288
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,040
What? That was a 45 Space Cruiser,
a lowrider with sport suspender!

289
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,280
Trace elements made of Burmese titanium!
It made double speed of light

290
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,560
in less than 1.5 seconds!
That kind of machine cannot be painted

291
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,240
- in Pink Camouflage!
- Try to be sensible, Mr. Thats-It.

292
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,840
- Our problems are of a different nature.
- Well, I don't care about your problems!

293
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,040
All I care about is that
my cab is totalled because I had to

294
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,440
- bring you these three hoes!
- I bet he's that small.

295
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,800
You guys pay for the repairs
and I'm out of here. Okay?

296
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,720
And until that happens,
I'll just sit here, on this chair, and wait.

297
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,040
Well, I don't know about you,
but I could do with some coffee now.

298
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,240
- Chocolate?
- Nooo!

299
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,800
- It's bitter chocolate by Rosetto.
- It's the brand with the Rosetto-Moor.

300
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm...

301
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
not ready for that.

302
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,960
- Who is that?
- A cab driver. We still need to pay him.

303
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,080
Ladies and Gentlemen...

304
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,120
The chairman of the
intercontinental security counsil.

305
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,800
Majesty!

306
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,680
Esteemed senators!

307
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,440
300 years ago,
on July 22nd, 2004 at precisely 5.35 pm,

308
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,880
a UFO crashed into
the desert of Nevada.

309
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,400
In that UFO, our scientists found
information from a galaxy far far away.

310
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
It was only with that knowledge
that we were able to colonize Mars.

311
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,400
We could prevent the colonization
of Mars and thus, this war,

312
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,400
by travelling into the year 2004

313
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
and destroying implied UFO.

314
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
But how can the UFO be completely neutralized?

315
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,520
With this Swiss laser!

316
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Know a nice place to go clubbing?

317
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,040
- Captain?
- Yes, right, absolutely!

318
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,880
- That's how I would do it.
- Good. Because it's you who will be doing it.

319
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,000
- What? - That'll be great.
- We? No dice!

320
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,040
- That's totally impossible!
- We don't have time for something like that.

321
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,680
- We need to prepare for the Miss Waikiki contest.
- If you refuse this mission,

322
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,760
- there will never be a Miss Waikiki contest again.
- Bring in the time machine!

323
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,920
- Spotty, Smock, follow me.
- I want the window seat!

324
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Shouldn't we tell them the
machine has never been tested?

325
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Captain...
you are our last best hope.

326
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,240
- What? I'd rather send a monkey to do this.
- Animal welfare wouldn't let us.

327
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,120
You should put on these glasses.
Time travel is bad for your eyes.

328
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,280
The ignotion key will start the machine.
With these coordinates

329
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
you set destination time and place.

330
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,280
- Stop it or we'll leave you here!
- Confirm by pressing the green button.

331
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,800
This button activates a countdown.
Everything else is in this book.

332
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
Don't lose it! You'll never be able
to return without it. And don't waste energy.

333
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,360
- The manual!
- Spotty, travelling with you is no fun at all!

334
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
I'll get it!

335
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,360
The Cookie squadron launches a
large-scale attack! All exits are blocked!

336
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,640
We must get you to a safe place.
We have no choice. Get onto the time machine!

337
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,960
I'll stay here until my cab has been repaired!

338
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,800
Senator! There's something
you need to know!

339
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
What is it?

340
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,880
I forgot to pack my bra.

341
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
- Here. Take mine.
- Thank you!

342
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,400
It's okay.

343
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,400
Press the start button!

344
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,120
Got it!

345
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Spotty! Heel!

346
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,840
Maybe I'll find a better place to sit.

347
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,520
- Yee, here we go!
- Spotty!

348
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,720
This will have serious consequences!

349
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,160
- What are you doing here? - I wonder, too.
- You're messing everything up!

350
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,240
- Does this thing have a seat heater?
- No, but I sat there just a moment ago.

351
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,120
Spotty is sneaking out of this again!
Now it'll be single room, definitely!

352
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,120
Brace yourself! Glasses on!

353
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,560
- I am glad to see you, Lord Shawl.
- Boot licker.

354
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,720
- What's that?
- Rosetto's bitter chocolate.

355
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,800
- It's the brand with the Rosetto-Moor.
- Thanks. Kick off.

356
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,880
The government building of the Earth alliance
was successfully taken over. - Excellent.

357
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,960
- All politicians were locked into the washhouse.
- Perfect.

358
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,800
- Metapha was able to escape on a time machine.
- What? How could you let that happen, asshole?

359
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,560
Yes. You're right. But we were able
to seize the manual of the time machine.

360
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,600
Goooood.

361
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm going to make a phone call.

362
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
Wow!

363
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,160
- It actually worked!
- Unbelievable.

364
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,480
- Now we can...
- Prevent my wedding! - What?

365
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,640
- We could see Elvis live!
- The end of the world is near

366
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,680
- and you think of Elvis?
- I dreamed of football just now.

367
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,840
I dreamed I was a pastry cook and
shaped a quarterback from marzipan.

368
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,920
I stuck a lucky coin on top of it
and put it into the shop window next to the tarts.

369
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,560
- What country did you enter?
- I didn't enter anything.

370
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,520
- Captain! Get up! Look, a pony!
- Where are we?

371
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
A petting zoo!

372
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,600
- Dammit!
- Oh my! Rowdies everywhere!

373
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,160
July 22nd, 1304. A short miss.

374
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,480
- Neat thing you got us into.
- I didn't do anything.

375
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Then maybe you should do something now.

376
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Keep cool, princess.
We'll be gone in a second.

377
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,960
Dear Romans! We came from
the future to save the world!

378
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,160
Smocky, take a picture.

379
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,160
Say cheeese cake!

380
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,080
Witchcraft! Catch them!

381
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm out of here!

382
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,700
- Who is he?
-Who?

383
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:16,329
- He!
- Ah, I see.

384
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,360
Who is he?

385
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,114
Speak, you sleazy son of a bitch!

386
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,329
- What did you do to the woman?

387
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,000
Now tell me, Is he of noble blood?

388
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,920
My name is Til Schweiger, and
I make my living as an actor.

389
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,186
It's not much, but it's enough for
two weeks of vacation in a year.

390
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:39,914
And what do you do all day long,
throne farter?

391
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,957
Mylord, he is a liar. This
man is certainly not an actor.

392
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,640
But he has got guts. I was
told he was a remarkable fighter.

393
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,160
An important tournament takes
place tomorrow. My honor is at stake,

394
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,360
but my best horseman was
overrun by a Crusade last week. Nasty thing.

395
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,880
- How about putting up danger signs?
- Do we have danger signs?

396
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,920
No, Sire, but the virgin Adrea
has some spare crosses.

397
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,800
- Yes! Put up Adrea's Crosses!
- Hey, great idea! Can I go now?

398
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,880
It is his fault my
subsitute fell from his horse.

399
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,920
Hence, he will have to win
the tournament for me tomorrow.

400
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,360
If he does, he is free. If he doesn't,
he and his entourage will be hanged

401
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,440
and the woman will be mine.
Cheers!

402
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,840
But Sire! Only those of noble blood
may take part in the tournaments!

403
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
That's right.

404
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,600
Hereby I knight you Sire of

405
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
of Behynde.

406
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Those Pigs travelled to the past to
eradicate our existence.

407
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:05,914
This is bad news.

408
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,729
Well, yes. Sure

409
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:10,457
But I also have good news for you.

410
00:38:10,614 --> 00:38:12,160
Go ahead.

411
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,360
This book contains a 
time machine construction manual.

412
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,342
- I turned my moped into one.
- And? Does it work?

413
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:23,099
Like you wouldn't believe, master!

414
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,414
Here is the proof. I just
got tomorrow's newspaper.

415
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:30,500
Regulator snatches the earth.
Four eyes bludgeoned with frying pan for treason.

416
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,643
Poor pig

417
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,320
- They won't write about me.
- For this to come true

418
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
you have to stop them!
Can you trace their route?

419
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,000
Sure. I'll sniff them
out with my sniff radar.

420
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,680
- Jens!
- Master?

421
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,480
There is something you need to know.

422
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,640
What?

423
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,680
Roughly 30 years ago
a baby came along.

424
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:03,000
Without sock and without shoe.

425
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:06,357
And that, dear Jens, that was you.

426
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,040
You lost me, my Regulator.

427
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,760
I... am... your father!

428
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,914
Sure thing Daddy. You can count on me. 
cyanara!

429
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,120
By the way, the Lady's dress
suits you remarkably well.

430
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
She wore it just yesterday
while being busy with the jester.

431
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,960
- You have a wife? - I had.
- Where is she now?

432
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,240
- Hanging outside.
- You hanged her outside? Why?

433
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,320
For the lack of indoor gallows.

434
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,880
- Two pizzas No. 33 for William the Endmost!
- To the Knight of Behynde!

435
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,280
Say, what is your star sign?
Well, your zodiac.

436
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,480
- You do have a zodiac, don't you?
- Well, yes... Virgo.

437
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,480
- A virgin!
- A virgin? Where? Finally! Bring her here!

438
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,440
I want one, too! Here first!
I was here before him! Shut up!

439
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,760
- Virgo goes wonderfully with Butterfly.
- That's no zodiac.

440
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,200
Yes, it is. In the Vulcanette
horoscope. I am a Butterfly.

441
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,400
We only have insects for zodiacs.
House Fly, Tse Tse Fly,

442
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,440
Blowfly, Mayfly...
or the Wasp!

443
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
- Want to see my ascendant?
- No, keep it where it is.

444
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,680
- Save that for your boyfriend.
- What? He's not my boyfriend.

445
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,800
He's just my captain.
He'd get lost without me all the time.

446
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,920
- Besides, he has no idea what women want.
- Neither do I. You have to be handsome...

447
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,920
Beauty is not that important.
What you need is humor.

448
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,080
I have! A doctor tells his patient
"I have good news and bad news."

449
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,240
"Good: You have one day to live."
"Bad: I forgot to tell you..."

450
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,920
"yesterday."

451
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,120
Forgot... yesterday...

452
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,160
Not bad.

453
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,560
Do you want to know the magical
question that sets every woman's heart on fire?

454
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Want to go shopping?

455
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,280
Shopping? And I always thought
women liked men who play the piano.

456
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,200
<i>Baby, I'm strollin' on top of the sky.</i>

457
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,960
<i>Why don't you, don't you, don't you,</i>

458
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,840
<i>Baby, come along with me?</i>

459
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,080
<i>Why don't you come along with me?</i>

460
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I don't think I will ever
marry. I wouldn't, at that.

461
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,000
Neither would I anymore.
My ex-wife took everything.

462
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,080
My house, my dog, my job...

463
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,760
even my hole puncher.

464
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,443
Oh my, now you can't even file anything away!

465
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:03,040
Oh well. Let me show you something. Here.

466
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,960
My little pink pal is the only thing left.

467
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,471
Oh, you little piggy you!
Say, can I touch it?

468
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,714
Of course.

469
00:43:13,114 --> 00:43:18,043
- Oh my, it's all shrivelled up!
- Well, it's been in there for a while.

470
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,000
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Come, push it.

471
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,200
- I'd like to have one myself.
- Come on, push it harder.

472
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,880
My, where is it? My, what's
it doing? My, there it is!

473
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,280
- I don't want to make it burst.
- It won't. My dog used to chew on it.

474
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,240
The joust: two knights try to push each
other off the horse with a lance.

475
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,171
If your friend goes down,
he loses and we will be married by tonight.

476
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:02,671
I don't think you two
would make a good couple.

477
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,057
- What's wrong?
- Well, how did we sleep last night?

478
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:15,920
- I didn't get a wink of sleep.
- Yes, I imagine.

479
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
- What's that on your foot?
- A shoe.

480
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,400
- Where did you get that from?
- My room mate had his leg hacked off

481
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,440
for no apparent reason.
I felt sorry and bought his shoe.

482
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,000
- Shut up, you witches!
- Your the witch

483
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,760
Dear Lords, dear Ladys,
dear mob!

484
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,160
Our dearest patronizing host, who is
delighted to see you all have come here...

485
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,200
Duke William the Endmost of Shareholding!

486
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,120
Dear Lords, dear Ladys!

487
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,920
Sir Further-Winston-Fattenberry of
West Firstwhistle-Minster-Shatwood Castle,

488
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,886
Third Count of Yorkshire Forest
Wooden-Lancester-Puddingham...

489
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,567
Not Puddingham It's Pettingham, you idiot!

490
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,080
Ah... oh... Right.

491
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,960
Sir Further-Winston-Fattenberry of
West Firstwhistle-Minster-Shatwood Castle,

492
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,040
Third Count of Yorkshire Forest
Wooden-Lancester-Pettingham,

493
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,280
Sir Richard Carsharing,

494
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:17,100
can not be with us today.

495
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,329
(Crowd) aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwww

496
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,840
Well well, the plague.
Stepping into the breach...

497
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,440
the mysterious Black Knight!

498
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:35,800
Competing against him, under
the crest of Duke William...

499
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,880
the Sassy Sire of Behynde!

500
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,920
I worked on that outfit all night.
But it was worth it.

501
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Loose screw, huh?

502
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,120
- Jens Shawl!
- Jawohl.

503
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,200
I will beat the Sassy Sire for you.

504
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:13,171
Faster you sow

505
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
- You have to cancel the tournament!
- Too late.

506
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,800
In case you care at all, I don't feel well.

507
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,040
I have to go bisi-bisi since last night,
but they don't even have toilet paper here.

508
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,400
Calm you sow!

509
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,200
- You need to raise your lance, Rocky!
- There. You're cooing. You said "Rocky"!

510
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,520
If the Black Knight wins we're all doomed!

511
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,840
- It's not the end of the world.
- You have no idea!

512
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,160
Jawohl!

513
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,000
- I can't take it much longer!
- Neither can I. Too bad about that outfit!

514
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,320
My bladder is about to explode
and you act like a halibut in the heat!

515
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,000
Rock!

516
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,240
- Didn't hurt at all.
- Think about our future!

517
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Don't worry, princess.
Let me handle this.

518
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,871
He could as well resign.
Your bosom will be mine!

519
00:47:57,914 --> 00:48:02,443
I'll rather go and puke
then let you touch me, Duke.

520
00:48:03,086 --> 00:48:07,014
<i>Put your Lanze in the air,</i>
<i>and rock it like you just don't care!</i>

521
00:48:07,015 --> 00:48:09,760
<i>Everybody say, oh yeahl</i>
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

522
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,280
<i>They asked me how I knew</i>

523
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,400
<i>My true love was true.</i>

524
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,960
<i>I of course replied,</i>

525
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,760
<i>"Something here inside</i>

526
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:56,920
<i>cannot be denied."</i>

527
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,360
Jawohl! Yes! Jawohl!

528
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,640
Yes! We're getting married!
Where's the priest?

529
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,520
Hey, don't touch! Hands off! Heh!

530
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,040
- What are you planning?
- Some little fireworks for our wedding.

531
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,880
I know how you feel.
I fell from the bunk bed when I was a kid.

532
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Excuse me! He's lying on top of my bladder.

533
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,960
Hey, wait!

534
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,400
What?

535
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,760
Oh Willy!
Do you want to make me happy?

536
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,640
Yeah, definitely!

537
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:49,886
Jawohl! Higher you pigs!

538
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,520
- I'm ready, Willy-Boy!
- Good! Move a little together, my dear!

539
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,840
They're getting away!
Let me down, assholes!

540
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,520
What a picture!

541
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,920
Stop it!

542
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,120
- Come on baby, where's the cheese cake?
- In here!

543
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,080
Cheeeeese cake!

544
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
Oh crap.

545
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,600
- They're gone!
- William's a sorcerer.

546
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,880
Well, burn him!

547
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,760
Now I'll go and meet my Lord
because of that bosom I adored.

548
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,880
- What happened?
- You were unconscious. We're there.

549
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,080
- Hey! Hey, stop pulling!
- Wishi-wishi, bisi-bisi

550
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,160
- Well, look!
- Oh thank God!

551
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,760
- C'mon, hurry, will ya?
- Yeah. Look, someone forgot his pants in here.

552
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,760
- Heave ho!
- Man, this is heavy!

553
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,040
That armoire goes up to the bedroom.

554
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Be careful! These are the
furniture of our new sheriff.

555
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,360
- It all has to be perfect tomorrow.
- Sure, mayor.

556
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,080
Oh, do be careful!

557
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,920
I dreamed of soccer just now.

558
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,160
I was a quarterback made of marzipan.
Someone stuck a lucky coin to my head and

559
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,240
put me into the shop window next to the tarts.

560
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,960
- Who was that?
- Some gay pastry cook.

561
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,840
Whoa whoa whoa!

562
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,320
- And where are the others?
- Piddling.

563
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,280
That was close. I wouldn't even wish
Bora-Bora such a full bladder.

564
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,800
Shouldn't have had all that asparagus.
Well, how do you like it?

565
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,160
- This outfit is so totally old fashioned.
- Poppycock and fiddlesticks!

566
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,640
- We won't stand out in this national costume.
- You're jingling.

567
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,440
I have a world to save!
Watch me, this is how you move in Nevada.

568
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,520
Shoulders up, swing your hips.

569
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Think of Johnny Weir
and don't forget your breathing!

570
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,440
Try it!

571
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,000
Forget it!

572
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:25,314
Ah, fresh asparagus soup!

573
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,280
It's still warm!

574
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,320
- Smocky.
- Leave me alone.

575
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,080
- How far is it to the ground?
- I don't know.

576
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,160
- Well, please look.
- I can't.

577
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,560
- This is the right place, but we're in the wrong time.
- Can you repair the time machine?

578
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,920
- Not without the manual.
- What do we do now?

579
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,720
First of all, find the girls.
Strange. I can't get rid of the feeling...

580
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,480
- they're somewhere around here.
- Last warning, Smock!

581
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,560
- How far is it to the ground?
- Forget it! - Are we being mutinous?

582
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,640
- That Rock guy is a bad influence for you!
- You're just being jealous!

583
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,520
- Be careful, will you!
- Hey. The princess is worrying about me.

584
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,560
- What do you mean?
- Well, if a woman worries about a man...

585
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,600
- I'm worrying about our mission!
- And I'm worried about my cab and my money.

586
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,320
What?

587
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,440
- But we're stuck here without the time machine!
- You should have been more careful.

588
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,749
- Oh, so it's my fault now?
- I couldn't I was unconscious.

589
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:47,960
- That's so typical!

590
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,640
You're a jealous gratin!

591
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,080
You'll look down now, or I'll tell
Mr. Rock that you have a green testicle!

592
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
You're such a bully!

593
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,720
- I took the rap for you, Lady!
- And who kicked that leather lump into my face?

594
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:11,760
If it wasn't for me, you'd be
a juicy steak at the stake!

595
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,600
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- What? - So you don't.

596
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,680
I'll tell you something. You like me.

597
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,200
- This is not about you! Got it?
- Excuse me, can I get my sports section back?

598
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,800
- Mayor Roony!
- That's all wrong!

599
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,400
- More to the left!
- Mayor Roony!

600
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,080
A telegraph from Roswell! It's horrible!

601
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,960
God be with us!
The former sheriff...

602
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,520
isn't cold and stiff yet,
and they're already coming back to town!

603
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,200
They're on the 12 o'clock train.

604
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,640
They're back!

605
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:21,720
- You have your mother's pulpy porridge butt!
- Travelling with you is no fun at all!

606
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,080
- I'm never taking you along again!
- So what? There are plenty of people

607
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,160
- who'd love to take me along!
- Who? That Rock-bottom maybe?

608
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,280
Yeah! Our knees touched,
and I got the feeling he 

609
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,360
wanted it too! Stop smirking!
Maybe I'll go to 

610
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,440
- Mykonos with him next year!
- I'm not giving you a holiday.

611
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,800
Sheriff Shorty? Ah, I thought
you'd arrive tomorrow. Anyway. Good luck!

612
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
And you're bigger than I expected!

613
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,880
- And which one is the sheriff?
- The one with the star, Jim.

614
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,960
- Then I'll go and save the world without you!
- Ha, you can't!

615
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,320
- Yes I can. - No you can't.
- Yes I can. - No you can't.

616
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,640
- Yes I can. - No you can't.
- Yes I can.

617
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,720
- I don't believe this.
- No you can't. I have the Swiss laser!

618
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
You sly Vulcanette cow!

619
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,520
- Hey, are you batty?
- I believe Shorty was shorter last time we met him.

620
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,840
Well, it's been what, 10 years?
He could have grown.

621
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,360
Dammit!

622
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Game over!
Daddy will be delighted!

623
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,200
He's got a moped!

624
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,760
Oh no, not again.

625
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,960
Crap!

626
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,760
What's wrong?

627
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,800
Get a grip, asshole!

628
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,440
John, you hold the sheriff off my back.
Jim, wash your hands and go inside.

629
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,720
Sorry, John.
I can't stay outside to play.

630
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,040
Don't worry. I found two new friends already.

631
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,400
- Shoes! - Yes, boss.
- John, you have ten minutes.

632
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,200
We have a pub to sell
to the Apaches later today.

633
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,440
- We are from the...
- People Village!

634
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,520
- We are peace-loving Village People.
- Ladies and Se�oritas!

635
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,200
>From Medicine Bow, Wyoming,
it's your host for tonight: Mr. Santa Maria!

636
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,760
- Isn't he gorgeous?
- I'm your biggest fan!

637
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,880
Welcome to "The Santa Show"!
Our guest for today is Jim.

638
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,840
Hello, Jim.

639
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,840
- What did you bring us there, Jim?
- Rheuma blankets, boss.

640
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,800

- Really?

646

C'mon! Draw!

647
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,160
- What?
- Your pistol.

648
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,800
It's his first time!

649
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Geez, thanks!

650
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,400
- I can't get it out!
- Now you see what it's like.

651
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,680
- Are you alright, captain?
- Yes, but...

652
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:16,680
- Where's Rock?
- I'm really getting tired of hearing that name!

653
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,720
Who of you ordered a cab?

654
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,800
- Thank God, there he is!
- "Thank God, there he is!"

655
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:30,160
- You are a real hero!
- I know.

656
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,520
- But we don't drink champagne.
- The chief of the Apaches does.

657
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,120
- Oh look! Someone's lying there!
- Yes, that's my John.

658
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
My Regulator.
Your shuttle to Earth is ready.

659
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,200
- Has Lord Shawl reported in yet?
- No, my Regulator!

660
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,920
But we captured this man.
He pretended to be mowing the lawn.

661
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,240
He actually is part of the crew
that managed to flee with the time machine.

662
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,560
Interesting. I'm sure he can tell
us something about their plans.

663
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,440
I'm not saying anything!
I've already lost my reading lamp to this war!

664
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,480
- It can't get worse, can it!
- Then there is nothing I can do for you.

665
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,320
You fool!

666
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,440
Hermes!

667
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,680
Commence a press release:
High treason! Spectacle wearer...

668
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,120
- slain with a pan.
- Aye, my Regulator.

669
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,760
We have conquered Earth.
The Era of Darkness shall begin.

670
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,120
- I think this is our exit!
- I don't know how to slow this thing down!

671
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Jump off!

672
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,920
- Great! Now I got sand in my ears!
- No surprise, your ears are quite ample.

673
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,320
- Are you alright, princess?
- I think so.

674
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,520
Better.

675
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,240
That's our sofa!
Why is it smouldering?

676
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,600
What are you doing with our sofa?
It's not a toy, you know!

677
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,680
Now look how that looks!
It's so totally wrecked!

678
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,960
Do you even know who I am?
My name is Juergen Thorsten Kork,

679
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,120
captain of the Traumschiff Surprise.
I have the responsibility for this sofa

680
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,120
as well as for a crew of over 40 men.
And it's not always easy to make ends meet!

681
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,120
He repaired the time sofa!

682
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,760
Your turn!

683
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,400
Okay!

684
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,920
You...

685
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,629
You again.

686
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,960
- What is that?
- A corkscrew.

687
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,800
A magnifying glass.

688
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:16,640
No!

689
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,160
Your time is up!

690
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,920
The UFO!

691
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Time to say goodbye, french fry.

692
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,160
Rock!

693
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,400
Want to...

694
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,920
Want to go shopping?

695
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yes I do!

696
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:17,840
- See! Your time to coo is over, Smocky.
- I can still keep him on the back burner.

697
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
- There is something you have to know.
- What is it?

698
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,600
I...

699
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,720
- I really suck when it comes to sex.
- Oh Rock! So do I!

700
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,840
- Gee, what a cute thingy!
- Careful, Smock, it might bite.

701
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,440
Maybe I'll talk to him.

702
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,280
- Hello, stranger!
- Huh?

703
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,600
You friend or foe?

704
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,440
- Ah!
- Ah!

705
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,800
- A friend!
- A friend!

706
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,360
- Oh, I think the poor thing has catched a cold.
- Wait a sec.

707
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,920
You're a really good boy, aren't you?

708
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,240
- Look, now you broke it! You dumb cow!
- That's not enough, I'm afraid.

709
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,360
- We did it!
- That's all? This will change the future?

710
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,440
Even small things can have a big effect.

711
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,760
I don't know about you, but
I'm really homesick now.

712
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,240
- Yes!
- Yes!

713
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,800
- I wonder what awaits us at home.
- Hopefully a fresh cheese cake

714
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,760
in Honolulu, right, Smocky?

715
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,760
- There's not enough energy. Overload.
- Overload?

716
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,040
- We're too heavy. - What?
- We'll make 200 years, tops.

717
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,040
- We're 76.375 kg overweight.
- Oh no!

718
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,560
- How much are you?
- 54 kg.

719
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:45,520
- My beach weight's 75 kg.
- I'm 73. - What about you, Smocky?

720
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,280
Well, how much is it?

721
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,880
76 kilo and 375 grams.

722
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,640
Smocky?

723
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,200
Groans was right.
I'm just a fat Vulcanette.

724
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,400
Thanks for everything.

725
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:47,320
They found us.

726
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,360
Take this. Whenever you're lonely,

727
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,120
just press it.

728
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,880
Don't go!

729
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,800
- You have to go now.
- How could I, without you?

730
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,920
- I'll stay with you.
- No, you have to win the Miss Waikiki contest.

731
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,160
Smocky!

732
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,480
I'll always be with you, captain.

733
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,600
You're the bravest Vulcanette in the world!

734
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,200
Farewell!

735
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,240
Gotta run.

736
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,960
And you expect us to believe that story?

737
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,040
So you are a time traveller.

738
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,920
And you came from the year 2304

739
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,000
to save the world.

740
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,960
What do you think, Mr. Oilfield?

741
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,680
- Sir, he's telling the truth.
- Are you sure, Mr. Cornfield?

742
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,920
- Yes, Mr. Wheatfield. The lie
detector confirms it. He can fool us

743
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,400
- but he can't fool the machine.
- Please, Mrs. Ricefield.

744
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,480
Mr. Smock. Your story sounds truly...

745
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,720
- unbelievable.
- Geez, really.

746
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,400
But can you prove to us
that you are from the future?

747
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,400
- What the hell is that?
- Oh geez, I had forgotten about that!

748
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,240
I've never seen anything like it!

749
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,120
- It vibrates when it gets hot.
- Yes, General.

750
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,200
- A clinical thermometer with vibration.
- That's proof.

751
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,880
This man does indeed come from the future.

752
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,680
What is that?

753
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,400
Surprise!

754
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,600
- Welcome home, captain!
- What?

755
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,920
This is impossible....
You were just... I mean... you were...

756
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
- Why are you here?
- Well, you never believed me, did you!

757
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,560
Galapagos turtle!

758
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,640
Yesterday was my 335th birthday!

759
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,680
Three...! You haven't changed a bit!
No grey hair...

760
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,720
- no cellulite in your face! Nothing!
- Yes. Wasn't cheap though.

761
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,000
So you... waited for me for 300 years?

762
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,080
Yes. But I made good use of that time.

763
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,800
Isn't it beautiful?

764
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,800
How did you do that?

765
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,760
I sold our cheese cake recipe
to McDonald's.

766
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,000
Captain's log no. 1 of our
Traumschiff Surprise, Captain Kork.

767
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,160
Saved the world once more.
By destroying the UFO in 2004

768
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,280
we changed the future.
Mars was never colonized,

769
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,360
and Mr. Smock has refurbished
Earth during the last 300 years.

770
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,440
Now nothing can stop us!

771
01:14:57,686 --> 01:15:00,857
<i>'Cause we're so pretty</i>

772
01:15:00,858 --> 01:15:07,443
<i>and so canny and so slim and so slender</i>
<i>We'll be Miss Waikiki!</i>

773
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,040
<i>And shower to the left!</i>
<i>And shower to the right!</i>

774
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,000
<i>And don't forget the soap!</i>
<i>One more time!</i>

775
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,480
<i>And five, six, seven, eight</i>
<i>Five, six, seven, eight</i>

776
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,320
<i>And touch and push!</i>
<i>And touch and push!</i>

777
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,280
<i>And towel to the left!</i>
<i>And towel to the right!</i>

778
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,680
<i>And don't forget the willy!</i>
<i>Dry the willy to the beat!</i>

779
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,840
You can count on me, daddy.

780
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,040
I'm a Vulcanette vulgaris.
We can be up to 400 years old because we are

781
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,880
a type of Galapapago...

782
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,560
I'm a...

783
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,240
This thing farts!

784
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,440
Sure. I'll snaff them
out with my snaffledidap.

785
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,760
Yes!

786
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,400
- Klaus Kinski?
- Yes. I'm hovering. Come up.

787
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,160
Sure, Dad. Shoe
can count on me.... shshshsh...

788
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:35,240
- I am Hermes, messenger of the Gods.
- And whahamaminib?

789
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,480
They travelled to the past to
erararara...

790
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Rrrrrr! Rrrrrr!
I miss my moped.

791
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,360
- I used to be on the hovering club!
- On?

792
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,000
I made my license in freestyle hovering
when I washwei... shwe....

793
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,680
shwiba... hi there!

794
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,400
...when I was 12,
and I won the Federal Cross of Merit

795
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,480
at the national youth hovering con...
- Federal Cross?

796
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,960
- Put that pipe away!
- I am Hermes, messenger of the Gods!

797
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,080
<i>High, High, High-Ti-Tigh,</i>

798
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,960
<i>Space-Taxi to the sky.</i>

802
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,360
<i>... My little heart... </i>

803
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,440
<i>... spread your legs apart... </i>
<i> Check it out!</i>

804
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,200

<i>Eenie meenie miny moe!</i>

I...

808
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,400
- I forgot to pack my bra.
- Here.

809
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,920
Take m...

810
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,600
William is a sorcerer!

811
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,600
Sorry, mouth full.

812
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,520
Do you want to make me happy?

813
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,800
Yes, definitely!

814
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,640
My nose went up!

815
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,360
Sir Further-Winston-Fattenberry of
West Firstwhistle-Minster-Shatwood Castle,

816
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,040
Third Count of... Fuck!

817
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,880
Fuck, hey!

818
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,280
There are plenty of people who'd lovuff...

819
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:44,360
There are plenty of people who'd lovuff...

820
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,920
There are plenty of people who'd lovuff... sorry!

821
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,400
There are plenty...

822
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,800
Do you even know who I am?
I am Captain Juergen Thorsten Kork from the

823
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,600
Planet of the Apes. Sorry.

824
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,120
Bring me a Quattro staggioni, okay?
And turn that stupid music off.

825
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,600
Now, be honest, Smocky.
Didn't you get incredibly bored

826
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,680
without me during the last 300 years?

827
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,080
Oh well, I had a little lie-in...

828
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,960
- visited my relatives
- That's nice.

829
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,040
- I did my tax return.
- Yes, that's important.

830
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,160
And then I won bronze...

831
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,480
at the Olympic Games of 2068
in the ladies team showering.

832
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,560
Oh, really! Our Smocky has
always been an ace, hasn't he?

833
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:18,200
- What's up, Spotty?
- Captain, I beamed someone up.

834
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,400
- He wants to join in with us!
- Send him up. He'll get some cheese cake, too!

835
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,360
Aye aye, my captain!

836
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,520
Well, who could it be!

837
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,600
Come in! 

838
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,880
- Servus!
- Voil�! Anyone need a pearl diver?

839
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,000
Fascinating.
